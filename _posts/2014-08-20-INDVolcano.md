##<strong>Improving Data Poor Environments</strong>

![Flee](http://i.imgur.com/vwdh3dW.jpg)

Many active volcanoes lack open data about the buildings and infrastructure surrounding them, making it difficult to ascertain the risk posed by volcanic hazards. This problem is especially evident in Indonesia; Figure 1 below demonstrates the extent of this problem. Kediri, a town 19 miles to the West of Mount Kelud in East Java was evacuated earlier this year when threatened by Kelud’s February eruption. Despite this, virtually no effort has been made to map the homes and infrastructure of this or any other surrounding town. Determining the extent and distribution of risk to local infrastructure posed by Kelud is just as difficult today as it was before its most recent eruption.

The open data community is working on fixing these data gaps around the world. Figure 2 highlights the infrastructure added to OpenStreetMap (OSM) for a different areas in Indonesia, in this case central Jakarta. OpenStreetMap, often referred to as the Wikipedia of maps, is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Jakarta has received much attention and effort from this community and the local open data community.

All of the dark tan polygons displayed on the right of Fig. 2 are descriptions of Jakarta’s buildings which were added to OSM, They are now available not just in the picture or on OSM’s website but to download by anybody for free for use in a variety of software. This data can be used in hazard risk models, to inform development decisions or for a variety of other purposes.

##<strong>USAID/OFDA Use of Limited Data</strong>
<ol></ol>
###Decision Making

USAID/OFDA is already using OpenStreetMap data for planning. Taken from the latest Indonesian Fact Sheet, these images show the information constraints USAID/OFDA currently faces. The OFDA regional team and their partners are actively planning evacuation routes using the best available data.

###Hazard/Risk Modelling

The severe lack of Open Data around Volcanoes in Indonesia was highlighted by OFDA’s Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) as posing particular challenges to its ability to model the risks posed by volcanic hazards in these areas. VDAP is interested in creating data for these vulnerable areas and working with their counterparts in Indonesia to use these data to improve hazard assessments. They have highlighted 10 priority volcanoes.

##<strong>Volunteer Data Creation</strong>

In an effort to assist USGS's Volcano Disaster Assistance Program and USAID/OFDA's Indonesian Programs, it was determined that a data creation event centered around the OpenStreetMap platform would be the most optimal way to both create data and engage the local Indonesian community.

###What is Volunteer Data Creation?

Volunteer data creation refers to activities that encourage a group of volunteers to apply their knowledge and skills to synthesizing or compiling spatial information from a variety of sources (such as satellite imagery) and editing that information into a database that is freely open and available to the humanitarian community. Often these activities are organized around specific events called mapping parties in which participants meet to edit the map together.

As previously mentioned, activities are typically organized around editing data into OpenStreetMap. OSM is preferable to many alternatives because of the liberal licensing of its data and the robust toolchain built around it. The quality of the tools built to interact with OSM reflects the interest it has garnered from humanitarian agencies in that many of these have been developed with support from agencies like the Department of State/HIU, USAID/Geocenter, International Red Cross, not to mention our own. OFDA helped fund an update to the OpenStreetMap tasking server which was build to aid in the coordination of volunteer mapping events.

A couple recent examples include:

<div class="message">

<li>Department of States collaboration with the International Red Cross (IRC) Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to perform damage assessments in Tacloban after cyclone Yolanda. http://bit.ly/1wMBS37</li>
<ol></ol>
<li>IRC’s collaboration with Department of State’s Humanitarian Information Center mapping out communities in west africa affected by the Ebola outbreak. http://bit.ly/ZeRWj2</li>

</div>

Previous mapping parties have looked very different depending on what is being mapped and the level of local knowledge required to do so. Sometimes they require extensive training support or necessitate some level of local knowledge and sometimes basic knowledge about how to navigate a browser is sufficient to enable successful contribution. Luckily, infrastructure around volcanoes is easy enough to trace from satellite imagery so the barriers to entry for interested volunteers are low for contributing to our shared data on this theme. Although local knowledge is always helpful in adding depth to data, these activities can scale dramatically when a broad volunteer base is appropriate.

Beyond the collection of of useful data, volunteer mapping also serves as a productive outreach vehicle. These activities convene interest around a specific theme and give interested parties an avenue to participate in international humanitarianism productively. VDAP is specifically interested in ways to get Indonesians to participate in mapping infrastructure around Volcanoes.

A glance at the list of previous volunteer mapping activities highlights and it is easy to see from the various agencies and NGO’s participating that these activities tend to be highly collaborative by nature with a number of Agencies and NGO’s bringing their particular strengths to bear. Below is a selection of institutions and potential collaborators with assets useful to volunteer mapping in Indonesia.

##<strong>Proposal</strong>

An event aimed at promoting the creation of data on the location and distribution of buildings, roads and agricultural fields around a 50 km radius of the 10 volcanoes in fig. 3. The event would take place March/April 2015 and could be handled in two ways. If encouraging Indonesian participation is not identified as an explicit goal than we could continue on with this activity focused around a domestic event at no cost to OFDA save for some staff time. If we aim to encourage Indonesian volunteerism than some funding would be necessary to secure an international partner who can host a linked event in Indonesia and assist in coordination and outreach.

It is expected that in March 2015, volcanoes in Indonesia will not be receiving the consistent media coverage that has focused the public’s attention and increased volunteers. Because of this, special outreach measures are necessary to garner support for this effort. The most effective way to perform this outreach is through partnership and by leveraging the resources of the intra-agency.

The following efforts will help to elicit participation in this activity:

<div class="message">
<strong>DC Mapping Event</strong>
<ol></ol>
<li>Hosting the activity under the umbrella of USAID/Geocenter’s “Mapping for Resilience” program will ensure that the mapping event is incorporated into a GIS class at a local university (George Washington University) guaranteeing a base level of participation.</li>
<ol></ol>

<strong>Indonesia Mapping Event</strong>
<ol></ol>
<li>DoS/HIU MapGive training documentation can be translated to Indonesian to ensure training materials are available to assist less skilled participants.</li>
<li>Indonesian partner (yet to be identified) will promote the activity to local Indonesian Universities, identify a location for the mapping event and host it.</li>
